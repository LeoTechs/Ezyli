Algorithm CanTravelWithR
Input: R (the request accepted by the driver), L (the list of client requests)
Output: RESULT (the list of client requests with which the driver can travel)

Ensure: R != null, L != null

Begin
  Initialize an empty list RESULT

  For each clientRequest in L do 
    If TravelCompare(R, clientRequest) then
      Add clientRequest to RESULT
    End If
  End For

  Return RESULT
End
